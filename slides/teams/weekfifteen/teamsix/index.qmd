## Intro 

::: {.fragment}
- Can a problem be intractable on a **standard** Turing Machine but tractable when solved by a Python program?
- Can a problem be intractable on a **multiple tape** Turing Machine but tractable when solved by a Python program?
- Can a problem be intractable on a **multiple read-write** Turing Machine but tractable when solved by a Python program?
