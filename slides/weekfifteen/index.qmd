# Learning objectives

::: {.fragment .callout-note icon=true title="Learning Objectives for Theoretical Machines"}

- **CS-204-1**: Use both intuitive analysis and theoretical proof
techniques to correctly distinguish between problems that are tractable,
intractable, and uncomputable.
- **CS-204-2**: Correctly use one or more variants of the Turing machine
(TM) abstraction to both describe and analyze the solution to a
computational problem.
- **CS-204-3**: Correctly use one or more variants of the finite state
machine (FSM) abstraction to describe and analyze the solution to a
computational problem.
- **CS-204-4**: Use a formal proof technique to correctly classify a
problem according to whether or not it is in the P, NP, NP-Hard, and/or
NP-Complete complexity class(es).
- **CS-204-5**: Apply insights from theoretical proofs concerning the
limits of either program feasibility or complexity to the implementation
of both correct and efficient real-world Python programs.

## Key insights for proofgrammers

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.85em;"}

- {{< iconify fa6-solid check-circle >}} **Polyreductions**: Compare
problem difficulty via transformations
- {{< iconify fa6-solid check-circle >}} **Three conditions**: pos→pos,
neg→neg, and polytime
- {{< iconify fa6-solid check-circle >}} **SAT problems**: CircuitSAT,
SAT, and 3-SAT are fundamental
- {{< iconify fa6-solid check-circle >}} **Polyequivalence**: $F \equiv_P
G$ means equal difficulty
- {{< iconify fa6-solid check-circle >}} **Proof technique**: Describe
transformation, verify conditions
- {{< iconify fa6-solid check-circle >}} **Next chapter**: NP-completeness
builds on these ideas!

**Polyreductions are the foundation of complexity theory**: they let us prove
that problems are equally hard and establish a hierarchy of difficulty. Next,
we'll use these tools to identify the "hardest" problems in NP!
